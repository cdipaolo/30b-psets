\begin{problem}[11.15]

    Two hallways, of widths $a$ and $b$, meet at right angles (Figure 25). What is the greatest possible length of a ladder which can be carried horizontally around the corner?

    (Note that you might want to see the figure in the book if you can't visualize this.)

\begin{problem}[11.16]

    A garden is to be designed in the shape of a circular sector (Figure 26), with radius $R$ and central angle $\theta$. The garden is to have a fixed area $A$. For which value of $R$ and $\theta$ (in radians) will the length of the fencing around the perimeter be minimized?

\begin{problem}[11.35]

    Suppose that $f$ and $g$ are two differentiable functions which satisfy $fg^\prime - f^\prime g = 0$. Prove that if $f\pn{a} = 0$ and $g\pn{a} \ne 0$, then $f\pn{x} = 0$ for all $x$ in an interval around $a$. Hint: On any interval where $f/g$ is defined, show that it is constant.
