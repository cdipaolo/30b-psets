# Harvey Mudd Math 30b Problem Sets

Will include instructions on how to use LaTeX to compile this into PDF's when I get time (which is scarce)

## How to Use LaTeX?

I highly recommend any people who are not familiar with LaTeX starts with a widely available pdf online called ‘The Not So Short Introduction to LaTeX’. And if money allows, the book called ‘The LaTeX Companion’ is the go-to-place for thorough LaTeX and TeX understanding. 

The Not So Short Introduction To LaTeX: https://tobi.oetiker.ch/lshort/lshort.pdf 
The LaTeX Companion: http://www.amazon.com/LaTeX-Companion-Techniques-Computer-Typesetting/dp/0201362996

For editor, I personally use Texmaker and Texshop on Mac, with TeXLive 2015 Distribution. Texmaker is cross-platform, so Windows users can also use it. But bascially any plain text editor should work fine to edit and create tex files.

TeX Live: https://www.tug.org/texlive/

Install TeX Live or other TeX distributions to compile .tex files.

## Specific compile instructions?

### For Texmaker users:

Go to this page: http://www.xm1math.net/texmaker/doc.html, skip to the third section. Open the .tex file, and follow the instructions.
